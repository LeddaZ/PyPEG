# PyPEG
Python script to transcode videos with ffmpeg.

# Setup guide
Just install Python and ffmpeg and add the three executables `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` and `ffplay` to path (this should not be necessary if you install ffmpeg from a package manager, e.g. Homebrew on macOS or APT on Debian/Ubuntu)

_Don't expect this script to be good, I'm a noob and this is a thing I did for fun._
